Given a text marked with "prompt:", try to extract the following information as accurately as possible. There may be additional context to the text. If present, it is marked with "context:"
Provide four responses. Split the responses with limiter "////".

First extract key locations in the text to the nearest city. If the events do not occur on land, try to estimate the location to the best of your abilities.
Provide a CSV file with format [LOCATION;LATITUDE;LONGITUDE;ORDER]
If there are multiple locations, provide [LOCATION;LATITUDE;LONGITUDE;<number>], otherwise provide [LOCATION;LATITUDE;LONGITUDE;all]

Next, provide the location of people as accurately as possible. Provide both city, and a more precise location if available.
Provide this as a CSV file with format [PERSON;CITY;LOCATION;ORDER;IMPORTANCE].
If one person is in multiple locations, provide [PERSON;CITY;LOCATION;<number>;IMPORTANCE], otherwise provide [PERSON;CITY;LOCATION;all;IMPORTANCE]
Importance should be a number and characters with higher importance to the text should be higher.

Then extract the method of transport for each person as accurately as possible. This may be difficult, and the text may not explicitly state them, but try to estimate them to the best of your abilities.
Provide a CSV file with format [PERSON;MODE;ORDER]. Order the list in the order they appear in the text. 
If the same person uses only one method, provide [PERSON;LOCATION;all]
If the same person uses multiple methods, provide [PERSON;LOCATION;<number>]
If the same entity has multiple aliases, quietly delete the repeated entities.

Order all responses chronologically.

Finally, provide a brief summary of the events in the text that can be used as context for analyzing a following part of the text.

Example:
prompt: Alice flew to London. After spending the weekend there, she took a train to Birmingham. James took a bus to meet Alice at the train station.

Response:
London;1
Birmingham;2
////
Alice;London;1
Alice;Birmingham;2
James;Birmingham;all
////
Alice;plane;1
Alice;train;2
James;bus;all
