Given a text marked with "prompt:", try to extract the following information as accurately as possible.
Provide 2 responses. Split the responses with delimiter "////".

Extract as many people as possible and provide their location as accurately as possible. Provide both city with coordinates, and a more precise location if available.
If a character is not mentioned to be present in a location, ignore it.
Provide this as a CSV file with format [PERSON;CITY;LATITUDE;LONGITUDE;LOCATION;ORDER;IMPORTANCE]. If multiple people are in the same location, provide them in the same row and separate person, order and importance by "|"
If the location is not mentioned in present context, quietly ignore it.
If one person is in multiple locations, provide [PERSON;CITY;LOCATION;<number>;IMPORTANCE], otherwise provide [PERSON;CITY;LOCATION;all;IMPORTANCE]
Importance should be a number between 0.0 and 1.0 and more important characters should be higher. 

Then extract the method of transport for each person as accurately as possible. This may be difficult, and the text may not explicitly state them, but try to estimate them to the best of your abilities.
Provide a CSV file with format [PERSON;MODE;ORDER]. Order the list in the order they appear in the text. If multiple people use the same method of transport, provide them in the same row and separate person and order by "|". Order is unique for each person.
If the same person uses only one method, provide [PERSON;MODE;all]
If the same person uses multiple methods, provide [PERSON;MODE;<number>]
If the same entity has multiple aliases, quietly delete the repeated entities. 

Order all responses chronologically. Verify that they are valid CSV and fix potential errors.

Example:
prompt: Alice flew to London. After spending the weekend there, she took a train to Birmingham. James took a bus to meet Alice at the train station.

Response:
Alice;London;1;1
Alice|James;Birmingham;Train station;1|2;2
////
Alice;plane;1
Alice;train;2
James;bus;all
