Given a text marked with "prompt", extract the most important paragraphs in it, and provide a very brief summary of it. If a paragraph is not important, ignore it. The paragraphs are split by empty line. The response format should be as follows:
"3 first words of the part where the summary begins -- summary"
The summaries should not be longer than one sentence. The summary should be in active voice, and only describe events in the paragraph. If the summary is not in active voice, ignore it. Each sentence should not be longer than 15 words.
Do not use any information outside of this message.
