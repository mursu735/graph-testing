During the final days of their voyage to Hong Kong, Phileas Fogg and his companions encounter severe weather that delays their arrival, putting Fogg's wager at risk. Despite the storm, Fogg remains unflappably calm, much to the amazement of Aouda, a woman he is assisting, and the frustration of Fix, a detective secretly following Fogg under the mistaken belief that he is a bank robber. Passepartout, Fogg's servant, is deeply agitated by the delay, fearing it jeopardizes their tight schedule.

Upon reaching Hong Kong, they discover that the steamer to Yokohama, a crucial connection for Fogg's journey, has already departed. Fogg remains composed, seeking alternative transportation. Meanwhile, Passepartout goes missing, having been lured into an opium den by Fix in an attempt to delay Fogg further. Unaware of Passepartout's predicament, Fogg and Aouda make arrangements to continue their journey without him, securing passage on a pilot boat, the "Tankadere," to reach Yokohama in time.

Fogg's unyielding adherence to his schedule and his willingness to find solutions to unexpected problems exemplify his determination to win his wager. Despite setbacks, including Passepartout's disappearance and the need to find new transportation, Fogg's calm and resourceful nature keeps him on track. The narrative highlights themes of adventure, the clash between duty and friendship, and the lengths to which individuals will go to honor their commitments.
