During the final days of their voyage to Hong Kong, the passengers of the "Rangoon" face bad weather, which delays their arrival. Phileas Fogg remains calm despite the delay threatening his wager to circumnavigate the globe in 80 days. His servant, Passepartout, is frustrated by the delay, while detective Fix, who is secretly following Fogg under the suspicion that he is a bank robber, is pleased, hoping the delay will allow a warrant to catch up with Fogg. Upon arrival in Hong Kong, Fogg discovers that the steamer to Yokohama has already left, but he remains unflustered and seeks alternative transportation. He decides to charter a pilot boat to take him to Yokohama, despite the risks and the cost. Meanwhile, Passepartout goes missing, having been drugged and left in an opium den by Fix in an attempt to delay Fogg further. Fogg makes arrangements for the journey without Passepartout, unaware of his servant's predicament. The narrative highlights the contrasting reactions of the characters to the challenges they face, with Fogg's calm determination standing out against the backdrop of Fix's scheming and Passepartout's loyalty.
