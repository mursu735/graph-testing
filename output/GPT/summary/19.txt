Phileas Fogg, Aouda, Fix, and Passepartout continue their journey from Calcutta to Hong Kong on the steamer Rangoon. They face a storm which delays their journey and causes them to arrive in Hong Kong 24 hours late. Despite this delay, they find out that the next steamer to Yokohama, the Carnatic, had been delayed due to a boiler repair and would be leaving the next morning. Fogg arranges for Aouda's stay in Hong Kong and finds out that her cousin Jeejeeh, whom they were supposed to meet, had moved to Europe. Fogg decides to continue his journey with Aouda and Passepartout. In Hong Kong, Passepartout explores the Victoria Port and interacts with Fix, who reveals his true identity as a police detective. Fix tries to convince Passepartout to help him detain Fogg in Hong Kong, but Passepartout refuses.
