Phileas Fogg, Passepartout, and Sir Francis Cromarty continue their journey from Bombay to Allahabad. They travel by train through various cities and landscapes, engaging in conversation about their journey and the nature of India. The train journey ends abruptly at Kholby due to incomplete railway tracks. Fogg, determined to continue, purchases an elephant to carry them the rest of the way to Allahabad.
