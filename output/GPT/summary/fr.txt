Phileas Fogg's departure from London and his bet to circumnavigate the globe in a limited time sparked widespread public interest and debate. The news spread from the Reform Club to newspapers across England, generating articles both for and against Fogg's endeavor. While a few initially supported him, a detailed article from the Royal Geographical Society critiqued the feasibility of his journey, highlighting the numerous potential obstacles and the necessity of perfect timing. This led to a decline in public support, with betting odds heavily against Fogg. Despite dwindling backers, Lord Albemarle remained a staunch supporter, betting a large sum on Fogg's success. However, Fogg's situation worsened when a telegraphic dispatch from a detective named Fix identified him as a bank robber, leading to a complete loss of backers and transforming public perception of him from an adventurous gentleman to a criminal on the run.
