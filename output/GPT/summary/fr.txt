Phileas Fogg's decision to embark on a journey around the world following a wager at the Reform Club in London quickly became the talk of the town, capturing the imagination and skepticism of the public and press alike. The audacious bet that he could complete the tour in a minimal amount of time, given the era's travel limitations, was met with widespread disbelief. The majority of people, including respected newspapers and the Royal Geographical Society, deemed the venture impossible, citing numerous potential obstacles such as mechanical failures, natural elements, and the strict schedule required to make the connections necessary for success.

Despite the skepticism, the story of Fogg's wager sparked a betting frenzy among the English, known for their penchant for gambling. Initially, some support was garnered, especially after the Illustrated London News published his portrait. However, as logical arguments against the feasibility of the journey mounted, public sentiment shifted significantly against Fogg. The publication of a detailed critique by the Royal Geographical Society further dampened enthusiasm for his cause, leading to a decline in the value of bets placed on his success.

The situation took a dramatic turn when a telegraphic dispatch from a detective named Fix identified Phileas Fogg as a bank robber, suggesting that his real motive for the trip was to evade the law. This revelation caused Fogg's already waning support to evaporate entirely, transforming his public image from that of an eccentric gentleman to a criminal on the run. The once lively bets on his journey's outcome turned into a market of desperation, with his chances of finding backers plummeting. Even in the face of these overwhelming odds, Lord Albemarle remained a solitary supporter, driven by a belief in the capability of an Englishman to accomplish the feat, regardless of the venture's practicality or Fogg's tarnished reputation.
