The text describes a segment of the journey of Phileas Fogg, the protagonist of Jules Verne's "Around the World in Eighty Days," aboard the steamer "Rangoon" from Calcutta to Hong Kong. Aouda, a young woman Fogg has saved, is traveling with him, and they are getting to know each other better during the voyage. Aouda is grateful to Fogg for his rescue, and although Fogg is polite and attentive, he remains emotionally distant. The narrative also introduces Detective Fix, who is secretly on the same ship, hoping to arrest Fogg in Hong Kong based on the mistaken belief that Fogg is a robber. Fix contemplates various strategies to delay or arrest Fogg, considering even involving Fogg's servant, Passepartout, in his plans. However, upon learning about Aouda's presence and her story, Fix sees a new opportunity to interfere with Fogg's journey. The passage ends with Fix and Passepartout unknowingly reuniting on the "Rangoon" and planning to have a drink together, with Passepartout unaware of Fix's true intentions.
