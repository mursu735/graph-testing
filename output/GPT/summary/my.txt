The "Rangoon," a Peninsular and Oriental Company steamer, is on its journey from Calcutta to Hong Kong, carrying Phileas Fogg, his servant Passepartout, and a young woman named Aouda, whom Fogg has rescued from a dire fate in India. Aouda is grateful to Fogg and is getting to know him better during the voyage, although Fogg remains emotionally distant, ensuring her comfort with mechanical precision. Aouda, of high Indian heritage, hopes to find protection with her relative in Hong Kong, and Fogg assures her of his support, albeit in his usual reserved manner.

The journey is also secretly shared by Detective Fix, who is on Fogg's trail, believing him to be a bank robber. Fix has boarded the "Rangoon" discreetly, hoping to arrest Fogg in Hong Kong with a warrant that he expects to arrive there. He contemplates various strategies to delay Fogg's departure from Hong Kong if necessary, considering even to confide in Passepartout to turn him against Fogg. Fix is puzzled by Aouda's presence and considers using her situation to create complications for Fogg in Hong Kong.

As the "Rangoon" approaches Singapore, Fix decides to act. He reveals himself to Passepartout, feigning surprise at their meeting. Passepartout, unaware of Fix's intentions, shares Aouda's story and Fogg's plans with him. Fix, pretending ignorance, listens intently, realizing that his initial plan to use Aouda's situation against Fogg in Hong Kong might not be feasible. Nonetheless, he decides to stay close and wait for the right moment to act, signaling his intention to question Passepartout further and possibly alert the authorities in Hong Kong in advance of Fogg's arrival. The narrative captures the tension of the chase, the complexity of the characters' relationships, and the unfolding drama against the backdrop of a voyage through exotic locales.
