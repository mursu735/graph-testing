Phileas Fogg, a wealthy man from London, makes a bet that he can travel around the world in 80 days. He leaves London with his servant, Passepartout, first heading to Dover then to Calais and finally planning to reach Paris. They travel by cab and train. An article in the bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society criticizes the endeavor, causing Fogg's support to dwindle. A telegraphic dispatch from Suez to London accuses Fogg of being a bank robber, causing further loss of support. The steamer “Mongolia,” is due at eleven o’clock a.m. on Wednesday, the 9th of October, at Suez. The “Mongolia” plied regularly between Brindisi and Bombay _viâ_ the Suez Canal. Two men, the British consul at Suez and Fix, a detective, are waiting for the ship. Fix is in search of the bank robber and suspects that the robber might be on the Mongolia. The ship arrives and a passenger approaches Fix to ask for the English consulate. The passenger's master's passport matches the description of the bank robber.
