"The track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at the Great Salt Lake. From this point it described a long curve, descending towards Bitter Creek Valley, to rise again to the dividing ridge of the waters between the Atlantic and the Pacific." -- Engineers faced challenges in laying the railway through mountains, using subsidies to avoid obstacles.

"At eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of the waters at Bridger Pass, seven thousand five hundred and twenty-four feet above the level of the sea, one of the highest points attained by the track in crossing the Rocky Mountains." -- The train crosses the Rocky Mountains, facing challenges but successfully navigating difficult terrain.

"The locomotive whistled vigorously; the engineer, reversing the steam, backed the train for nearly a mileâ€”retiring, like a jumper, in order to take a longer leap." -- The train successfully leaps over a damaged bridge, narrowly avoiding disaster.
