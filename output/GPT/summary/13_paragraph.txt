The project was a bold one, full of difficulty, perhaps impracticable. Mr. Fogg was going to risk life, or at least liberty, and therefore the success of his tour. But he did not hesitate, and he found in Sir Francis Cromarty an enthusiastic ally.
The Parsee's narrative confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions in their generous design to rescue Aouda, a victim of a forced marriage and impending sacrifice. They planned a daring rescue mission at night, facing obstacles and danger.
The group attempted to rescue Aouda from a sacrificial pyre, with Passepartout's audacious move saving her. They escaped with Aouda, evading pursuit and leaving the crowd in awe.
