The project was a bold -- Mr. Fogg and his allies decide to rescue Aouda from her forced sacrifice.
They then discussed -- The group plans to rescue Aouda by entering the pagoda or making a hole in its wall.
As soon as night -- The group scouts the pagoda, finding the Indians in a state of opium-induced sleep.
They set noiselessly -- The group attempts to create an opening in the pagoda wall but is interrupted.
It would be difficult -- The group's plan to rescue Aouda is foiled, leading to frustration and disappointment.
The hours passed -- As the sacrifice begins, Passepartout executes a daring rescue of Aouda.
A moment after -- The group escapes with Aouda, evading pursuit from the priests and soldiers.
