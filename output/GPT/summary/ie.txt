The text describes a segment of Phileas Fogg's journey in Jules Verne's "Around the World in Eighty Days." Fogg commandeers the ship "Henrietta" to reach Liverpool, having locked the actual captain, Speedy, in his cabin. Fogg, with the help of his wealth, convinces the crew to support his commandeering of the ship. Despite challenges such as potential coal shortages and adverse weather conditions, Fogg manages the ship expertly, even resorting to burning parts of the ship to maintain steam power when coal runs low. Eventually, Fogg buys the "Henrietta" from Captain Speedy to burn its wooden parts for fuel. They reach Queenstown, Ireland, ahead of schedule, allowing Fogg to continue his journey to London. However, upon arriving in Liverpool, Fogg is arrested by Detective Fix, who has been following him, under the mistaken belief that Fogg is a bank robber. This arrest threatens to derail Fogg's attempt to win a bet that he can travel around the world in eighty days.
