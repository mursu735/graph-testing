The narrative follows the adventurous journey of Phileas Fogg, who, after commandeering the ship "Henrietta" due to the refusal of Captain Speedy to transport him to Liverpool, finds himself in command and on a direct course for his destination. Fogg's takeover is facilitated by his clever manipulation of the crew, who side with him over their captain, leading to Speedy's confinement. Fogg's adeptness at sea suggests a seasoned sailor, much to the amazement of those around him, including his loyal servant Passepartout and the perplexed detective Fix, who is on Fogg's trail for a robbery he believes Fogg committed.

The journey on the "Henrietta" is fraught with challenges, including potential shortages of coal and adverse weather conditions that threaten to delay their progress. Despite these obstacles, Fogg remains determined, employing every possible means to maintain speed, including the eventual burning of parts of the ship to fuel the boilers. This drastic action underscores Fogg's unwavering commitment to his goal, even as it astonishes and worries his companions.

As they near their destination, the shortage of coal becomes critical, prompting Fogg to negotiate the purchase of the "Henrietta" from Captain Speedy with a generous offer that the captain cannot refuse.
