Passepartout, in Yokohama, decides to sell his European clothes for a Japanese outfit to blend in while he tries to figure out how to get to San Francisco. He considers offering his services as a cook or a servant on a steamer headed for America. He then sees a placard advertising for the United States and follows it to a cabin, where he meets the Honourable William Batulcar, a Barnum-like figure who runs a troupe of performers. Passepartout ends up joining the troupe as a performer and plans to leave for San Francisco in a week. During a performance, Passepartout spots his master, Phileas Fogg, and Aouda in the audience. After the performance, they all board an American steamer to continue their journey.
