The text describes the events leading up to and the dispatch of a telegraphic message about Phileas Fogg, a suspect in a bank robbery, by Detective Fix. The "Mongolia," a fast steamer, is due to arrive in Suez, where Fix is waiting to identify and follow Fogg, who he believes is fleeing with a large sum of stolen money. Fix, having received a description of Fogg from London, is anxious and impatient for the steamer's arrival. He discusses with the British consul at Suez about the reliability of the "Mongolia" and his plans to identify Fogg among the passengers. Upon the steamer's arrival, Fix scrutinizes the disembarking passengers and encounters Fogg's servant, Passepartout, who unwittingly provides Fix with information that further convinces him of Fogg's guilt. Fix then decides to send a dispatch to London for an arrest warrant and plans to follow Fogg to Bombay to arrest him there. The narrative highlights Fix's determination to capture Fogg, his interactions with the British consul and Passepartout, and his strategic planning to ensure Fogg's arrest.
