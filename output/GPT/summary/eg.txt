The passage describes the circumstances surrounding a telegraphic dispatch sent about Phileas Fogg, a character in Jules Verne's "Around the World in Eighty Days." The setting is Suez, where the steamer "Mongolia" is expected to arrive. The "Mongolia" is a fast steamer that travels regularly between Brindisi and Bombay via the Suez Canal. Among the crowd waiting for the steamer's arrival are the British consul at Suez and a detective named Fix, who has been dispatched from England to capture a bank robber. Fix is anxious for the steamer's arrival, hoping to identify the robber among the passengers.

Fix engages in conversation with the consul, expressing his determination to catch the robber, who he suspects might be on the "Mongolia." Despite the consul's skepticism about Fix's ability to recognize the criminal, Fix is confident in his skills. The "Mongolia" arrives, and among the passengers disembarking, Fix notices a man asking for directions to the English consulate to have his passport visaed. This man matches the description of the bank robber Fix is after. The man turns out to be Phileas Fogg's servant, Passepartout, who unwittingly leads Fix to believe that Fogg is the robber he's chasing.

Fogg, meanwhile, is focused on his journey around the world, meticulously keeping track of his travel times and destinations. He is indifferent to the detective's suspicions and continues with his plans without delay. Fix, convinced that Fogg is his man, decides to follow him to India, planning to arrest him there with a warrant. He sends a dispatch to London requesting the warrant and boards the "Mongolia" to pursue Fogg.

The passage highlights themes of adventure, the clash between duty and personal ambition, and the misunderstandings that can arise from assumptions. It sets the stage for a global chase, with Fix determined to capture Fogg, who is oblivious to the detective's intentions and focused solely on his bet to travel around the world in eighty days.
