Phileas Fogg, Passepartout, and Aouda continue their journey from Kholby to Allahabad by elephant. They then take a train to Benares, where Sir Francis departs. The trio continue on to Calcutta, with plans to take a steamer to Hong Kong. However, upon their arrival in Calcutta, they are arrested and brought before Judge Obadiah on charges of sacrilege. Despite the charges, Fogg remains determined to continue their journey and posts bail for their release. They leave the courthouse and proceed to the harbor, where they take a boat to their steamer, the "Rangoon". The group is followed by a detective named Fix, who is hoping to recover stolen money he believes Fogg has.
