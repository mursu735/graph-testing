The group, consisting of Phileas Fogg, Passepartout, Aouda, and Fix, travels from New York to Liverpool by ship, despite several challenges including missing their intended steamer and having to negotiate passage on the trading vessel "Henrietta." Phileas Fogg takes command of the ship after the captain refuses to carry him to Liverpool. The journey is fraught with difficulties, including a lack of coal and bad weather. However, they manage to reach Liverpool with only six hours to spare for Fogg to win his wager. Upon arrival, Fogg is arrested by Fix.
