Phileas Fogg, Aouda, Passepartout, and Fix are travelling by train from San Francisco to New York. They stop at Elko where they meet Elder William Hitch, a Mormon missionary who delivers a lecture on the train. Despite most passengers losing interest, Passepartout stays to listen. The train reaches the Great Salt Lake and stops at Ogden where the group visits Salt Lake City. Here, they witness the Mormon lifestyle and Passepartout expresses his discomfort with the idea of polygamy. As they leave Salt Lake City, an unnamed Mormon man rushes to board the train, having fled from a domestic dispute.
