The detective Fix and Passepartout, Mr. Fogg's servant, continue to interact on their journey, with Fix carefully observing Fogg without revealing his true intentions. Passepartout speculates about Fix's persistent presence and mistakenly concludes that Fix might be an agent sent by Fogg's friends from the Reform Club to monitor the journey. Meanwhile, Fogg and Aouda spend time together, and the group makes a stop in Singapore, where they explore the local scenery and wildlife. Despite encountering bad weather and mechanical issues with the ship, which frustrate Passepartout, Fogg remains unbothered, focused on maintaining their schedule. Passepartout playfully teases Fix about his intentions, unknowingly causing Fix to worry that his cover as a detective might be blown. Fix contemplates revealing his mission to Passepartout if he cannot arrest Fogg in Hong Kong. Throughout these events, Fogg remains detached and focused on his goal, unaffected by the potential romantic interest from Aouda or the challenges they face during their travels.
