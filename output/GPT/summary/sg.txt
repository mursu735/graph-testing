In this segment from Jules Verne's classic novel, the interactions between the characters Passepartout, his master Phileas Fogg, and the detective Fix are further developed as they continue their journey around the world. Passepartout grows increasingly curious about Fix's persistent presence and eventually concocts a theory that Fix might be a spy sent by Fogg's friends from the Reform Club to ensure Fogg's adherence to his ambitious travel plan. Despite his suspicions, Passepartout decides not to inform Fogg, thinking it would be inappropriate to suggest that Fogg's integrity was being doubted by his friends.

Meanwhile, the narrative follows the travelers to Singapore, where Fogg and Aouda disembark for a brief exploration of the island, showcasing its lush landscapes and exotic flora and fauna. Fix continues to shadow them discreetly, while Passepartout engages in local commerce, purchasing mangoes. The journey then proceeds towards Hong Kong, with the intention of catching a steamer to Yokohama. The travelers face some challenges due to the weather and the "Rangoon's" condition, which frustrates Passepartout but seems to leave Fogg unfazed.

Throughout these events, Passepartout and Fix engage in light-hearted banter, with Passepartout teasing Fix about his secretive nature and hinting that he knows more about Fix's intentions than he truly does. Fix, puzzled by Passepartout's insinuations, begins to worry that his cover as a detective might be blown, contemplating revealing his mission to Passepartout if he cannot arrest Fogg in Hong Kong.

The narrative captures the essence of a grand adventure in the late 19th century, filled with exotic locales, the challenges of travel, and the intriguing dynamics between characters with differing motives. Fogg remains a figure of calm determination, seemingly oblivious to the suspicions and machinations of those around him, while Passepartout's loyalty and curiosity drive much of the interaction with Fix, the detective whose mission is to apprehend Fogg under the mistaken belief that he is a robber.
