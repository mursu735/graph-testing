Phileas Fogg, a wealthy and precise Englishman, embarks on a daring wager to circumnavigate the globe in 80 days. Alongside his loyal servant Passepartout and the rescued Indian woman Aouda, Fogg faces numerous challenges, including wrongful arrest due to a case of mistaken identity. Despite these obstacles, Fogg's meticulous planning and calm demeanor see him through various modes of transportation and across continents. However, upon returning to London, Fogg believes he has missed his deadline by a day, not realizing he has actually gained a day by traveling eastward, thus winning the wager.

Fogg's journey is not just a physical one but also a personal transformation. Initially embarking on the trip for the sake of a bet, he ends up finding love in Aouda, who proposes marriage to him upon their return. Fogg's victory is not in the financial gain from the wager, which is minimal after the expenses of the journey, but in the unexpected personal happiness he finds. The story concludes with Fogg's realization that the true reward of his adventure is the love and companionship he has gained, making him the happiest of men. This classic adventure novel by Jules Verne is not only a tale of a remarkable journey but also a story of personal growth and the discovery of life's true treasures.
