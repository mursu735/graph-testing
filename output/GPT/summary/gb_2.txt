Phileas Fogg, mistakenly arrested as a bank robber, is imprisoned but maintains his calm demeanor despite the dire situation. His servant, Passepartout, blames himself for not informing Fogg about Detective Fix's true intentions, which led to Fogg's arrest upon their return to England. Aouda, a young woman Fogg saved during his travels, is distraught over his arrest. Eventually, Fix realizes the real bank robber has been caught elsewhere, leading to Fogg's release. Despite the delays, Fogg manages to arrange a special train in a desperate attempt to complete his journey around the world in time to win a wager. However, upon reaching London, he believes he has missed the deadline by mere minutes. Resigned to his financial ruin but content with the adventures and relationships formed during the journey, Fogg discovers he has actually gained a day by traveling eastward, thus winning the wager. He generously shares his winnings with Passepartout and Fix, and proposes to Aouda, who accepts. The story concludes with Fogg and Aouda's marriage, highlighting that the true gain from his journey was not financial but the love and companionship he found.
