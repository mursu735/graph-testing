Phileas Fogg and his servant Passepartout are in Suez, Egypt, where they visit the consul's office to have Fogg's passport visaed. Detective Fix, who suspects Fogg might be a bank robber, joins them. After leaving the consulate, Fogg, Passepartout, and Fix board the ship "Mongolia". Fix continues to probe Passepartout for information about Fogg's hasty departure from London and his mysterious wealth. Fix becomes convinced that Fogg is heading to Bombay, not Suez, and sends a dispatch to London for a warrant of arrest. Fix, Passepartout, and Fogg all board the "Mongolia" to continue their journey.
