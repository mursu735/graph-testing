Phileas Fogg, Aouda, Fix, and John Bunsby miss their steamer to Yokohama from Hong Kong and negotiate with a sailor, John Bunsby, to take them on his boat "Tankadere". They face a perilous journey through the Chinese seas in November, dealing with boisterous seas and a typhoon. Despite these challenges, they manage to make significant progress towards their destination. They also suspect that Phileas Fogg's servant, Passepartout, might have mistakenly embarked on another ship and hope to find him in Yokohama. The “Carnatic,” setting sail from Hong Kong at half-past six on the 7th of November, directed her course at full steam towards Japan. Passepartout had mistakenly embarked on the "Carnatic" and woke up to find himself on the ship, now one hundred and fifty miles away from China. He realizes that his master, Phileas Fogg, and Aouda are not on board and that it was his fault that they missed the steamer. He arrives in Yokohama and wanders aimlessly through the city, considering his options.
