Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout arrive in America, where they encounter various adventures, including a daring rescue from a Native American tribe. Despite their efforts to catch a steamer to England, they miss it by mere minutes. Undeterred, Fogg attempts to find alternative transportation, eventually negotiating with Captain Speedy to take them to Liverpool on the "Henrietta" for a hefty sum. The journey across the Atlantic is their final obstacle in completing the circumnavigation within the stipulated time.
