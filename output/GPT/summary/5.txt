Phileas Fogg, a wealthy man from London, makes a bet that he can travel around the world in 80 days. He leaves London with his servant, Passepartout, first heading to Dover then to Calais and finally planning to reach Paris. They travel by cab and train. In their hurry to catch the train, Passepartout forgets to turn off the gas in his room. The news of the bet spreads and is widely discussed, with many doubting Fogg's ability to complete the journey in the given time. An article in the bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society criticizes the endeavor, causing Fogg's support to dwindle. A telegraphic dispatch from Suez to London accuses Fogg of being a bank robber, causing further loss of support.
