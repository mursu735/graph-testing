Phileas Fogg, Aouda, Fix, and John Bunsby miss their steamer to Yokohama from Hong Kong and negotiate with a sailor, John Bunsby, to take them on his boat "Tankadere". They face a perilous journey through the Chinese seas in November, dealing with boisterous seas and a typhoon. Despite these challenges, they manage to make significant progress towards their destination. They also suspect that Phileas Fogg's servant, Passepartout, might have mistakenly embarked on another ship and hope to find him in Yokohama.
