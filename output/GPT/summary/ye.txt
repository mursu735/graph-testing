The text describes a segment of a journey aboard the steamer "Mongolia" from Suez to Bombay, covering a distance of 1310 miles. The ship, filled with passengers bound for India, including military officers and wealthy Englishmen, makes good time thanks to the efforts of its engineer, promising to arrive ahead of schedule. Life aboard is luxurious, with abundant meals and entertainment, although occasionally disrupted by rough seas in the Red Sea. Among the passengers is Phileas Fogg, an impassive and routine gentleman who spends his time playing whist and showing little interest in the voyage's sights or the occasional rough weather. His servant, Passepartout, enjoys the journey and the company of a new acquaintance, Mr. Fix, an agent of the Peninsular Company, who takes a particular interest in Fogg's activities. The "Mongolia" stops at Aden for coal, a costly and necessary task for steamers at such distances from coal mines. Despite a brief delay for refueling, the ship gains time and arrives in Bombay two days ahead of schedule, to the satisfaction of Fogg, who meticulously records this gain in his itinerary.
