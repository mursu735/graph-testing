The passage describes a segment of the journey undertaken by the characters of a 19th-century novel, focusing on their voyage from Suez to Bombay aboard the steamer "Mongolia." The "Mongolia" is on a tight schedule, allotted 138 hours to cover the 1310 miles between Suez and Aden, aiming to reach its destination ahead of time thanks to the efforts of its engineer. The narrative highlights the diverse passenger composition, including British military officers, officials, and wealthy young Englishmen traveling to India, either to Bombay or Calcutta. The journey is depicted as generally pleasant, with high-quality meals and entertainment provided, although the Red Sea's unpredictable nature occasionally disrupts the tranquility on board.

Phileas Fogg, a key character, remains indifferent to the journey's scenic and cultural offerings, focusing instead on maintaining his routine, including playing whist with fellow passengers. His servant, Passepartout, contrasts Fogg's detachment by engaging with the journey and the other passengers, including a conversation with a man named Fix, who is secretly following Fogg for reasons yet to be disclosed fully.

The narrative also touches on the operational aspects of steamship travel, such as the significant expense of fueling and the strategic importance of stops like Aden for refueling. Despite a brief delay for coal, the "Mongolia" makes up time and arrives in Bombay ahead of schedule, benefiting Fogg's meticulously planned itinerary. Upon arrival, Fogg and Passepartout go ashore for passport formalities, with Fix discreetly trailing them. The passage concludes with the "Mongolia" reaching Bombay earlier than expected, marking a successful leg of Fogg's journey around the world, which he is attempting to complete in eighty days.
