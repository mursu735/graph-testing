During the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted with her protector, Phileas Fogg, who showed cold politeness but ensured her comfort. Aouda, a Parsee relative of a wealthy merchant, shared her gratitude and hopes with Fogg. The voyage from Calcutta to Hong Kong passed smoothly, with beautiful island views. Detective Fix, on board without being noticed, planned to arrest Fogg in Hong Kong to prevent his escape to China or Japan. Fix considered revealing Fogg's true nature to Passepartout as a last resort. Fix pondered over Aouda's presence with Fogg, suspecting a possible elopement and planning to use it against Fogg. Fix decided to warn the authorities and signal the "Rangoon" before reaching Hong Kong. Passepartout shared Aouda's history with Fix, who seemed unaware of the recent events.
