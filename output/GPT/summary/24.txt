Phileas Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout leave Shanghai on the "Tankadere" and reach Yokohama on the "Carnatic." They find Passepartout, who had previously been lost, and board the "General Grant" to San Francisco. Fix, who had been following them, also boards the "General Grant." Passepartout and Fix have a confrontation and agree to an uneasy alliance. They reach San Francisco without incident.
