In this excerpt from Jules Verne's classic adventure novel, "Around the World in Eighty Days," the protagonist, Phileas Fogg, commandeers the ship "Henrietta" to continue his journey to Liverpool, having locked the actual captain, Captain Speedy, in his cabin. Fogg, a gentleman of precise habits and considerable wealth, is on a wager to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days. His journey has been fraught with obstacles, but through a combination of wealth, wit, and determination, he has managed to stay on course.

Fogg's commandeering of the "Henrietta" is a bold move, driven by his need to reach Liverpool as quickly as possible. He cleverly wins over the crew with his banknotes and takes control of the ship, demonstrating his unexpected skill as a sailor. The journey is not without its challenges, including potential shortages of coal and adverse weather conditions, but Fogg's resolve never wavers. He even goes as far as to burn parts of the ship to keep the steam engines running when coal supplies run low.

The narrative also touches on the characters accompanying Fogg: Aouda, a woman he rescued in India, and Passepartout, his loyal servant. Both are deeply invested in the journey's success, though Passepartout also provides comic relief and a sense of human warmth to the adventure. Additionally, there's Fix, a detective who mistakenly believes Fogg to be a bank robber and is determined to arrest him once they reach England.

As the "Henrietta" approaches Ireland, Fogg devises a plan to gain time by disembarking at Queenstown and taking a train to Dublin, then a steamer to Liverpool, thus saving twelve hours. His plan works, and they arrive in Liverpool with just enough time to reach London before the deadline. However, just as victory seems within Fogg's grasp, Fix arrests him, throwing the outcome of his ambitious wager into uncertainty.

This segment of the novel is a thrilling example of Verne's ability to blend adventure, technology, and the human spirit. Fogg's journey is not just a physical circumnavigation of the globe but also a journey of determination, innovation, and unexpected camaraderie.
