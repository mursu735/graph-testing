The text describes a segment of Phileas Fogg's journey in Jules Verne's "Around the World in Eighty Days." Fogg commandeers the ship "Henrietta" to reach Liverpool, having locked the captain, Speedy, in his cabin. Fogg manages the ship with the help of the crew, who he wins over with money. Despite facing potential coal shortages and rough seas, Fogg keeps the ship moving by burning parts of it when coal runs low. He buys the ship from Captain Speedy to burn its parts for fuel, ensuring they can continue their journey. They reach Queenstown, Ireland, and Fogg plans to gain time by taking a train and then a steamer to Liverpool, aiming to reach London before his deadline. Upon arrival in Liverpool, Fogg is arrested by Fix, a detective who has been following him, believing Fogg to be a bank robber. This arrest threatens to derail Fogg's attempt to win a bet that he can travel around the world in eighty days.
