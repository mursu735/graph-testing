The text introduces Mr. Phileas Fogg, a wealthy, enigmatic English gentleman known for his precise and unvarying daily routine, living in London in 1872. Despite being a member of the prestigious Reform Club, little is known about his personal life or how he amassed his fortune. Fogg is described as a man of few words, leading a solitary life with habits that are both predictable and mysterious. He dismisses his servant for a minor mistake and hires a new French valet, Jean Passepartout, who seeks a tranquil life. Fogg then astounds Passepartout and his club members by betting Â£20,000 that he can circumnavigate the globe in 80 days. He immediately sets off with Passepartout, leaving London for Paris as the first leg of his journey. The news of his wager spreads, sparking debates and bets on his success or failure. A telegraphic dispatch from Suez to London later identifies Fogg as a bank robber, intensifying the public and police interest in his journey.
