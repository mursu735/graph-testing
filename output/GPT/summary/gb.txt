In 1872, Phileas Fogg, a wealthy and enigmatic Englishman living in London, makes a bold wager with members of his club. He bets Â£20,000, half his fortune, that he can circumnavigate the globe in 80 days. Despite skepticism from his peers and the public, Fogg sets out on his journey the same evening, accompanied by his newly hired French valet, Passepartout. Fogg's meticulous and unemotional demeanor contrasts sharply with Passepartout's more expressive nature. Their preparations are minimal, taking only a carpet bag with a few essentials, planning to purchase what they need along the way.

Fogg's departure causes a sensation in London, with many doubting the feasibility of his endeavor. The press and public debate his chances, and bets are placed on his success or failure. Meanwhile, a robbery at the Bank of England leads a detective to mistakenly identify Fogg as the culprit, further complicating his journey as he becomes a fugitive.

The narrative follows Fogg and Passepartout as they embark on their adventure, utilizing the period's advancements in transportation, including railways and steamships. Their journey is not just a race against time but also a test of Fogg's character and his commitment to his word. As they encounter various challenges and cultures around the world, the bond between master and servant strengthens. The story explores themes of adventure, loyalty, and the shrinking of the global landscape through technological progress, all while maintaining a light-hearted tone and a sense of suspense regarding Fogg's ability to complete his extraordinary journey and clear his name.
