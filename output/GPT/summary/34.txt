Phileas Fogg is arrested and imprisoned at the Custom House in Liverpool, suspected of being a robber. His companions, Passepartout and Aouda, are distraught and remain outside the Custom House, hoping to see him again. Fix, who made the arrest, is also present. The group then travels to London, with Fogg being transferred to a prison there. They manage to secure a special train to London after the express train had already left. Upon arrival in London, Fogg is released and promptly knocks Fix down. The group then heads to the Reform Club, but Fogg is five minutes late and loses his wager.
