The text describes a perilous sea voyage undertaken by Phileas Fogg, Aouda, and Fix aboard the "Tankadere," a small twenty-ton craft, from Hong Kong to Shanghai, covering a distance of eight hundred miles during a particularly dangerous time of year in the Chinese seas. Despite the risks of boisterous seas and terrible gales, especially during the equinoxes, the "Tankadere," under the command of Captain John Bunsby, manages to navigate the treacherous waters, propelled by favorable winds. Throughout the journey, the passengers face numerous challenges, including a threatening typhoon from the south, which promises to either aid their journey or potentially doom them. The crew and passengers endure the storm with remarkable resilience, and despite the severe weather conditions, they make significant progress. As they approach Shanghai, their destination, the calm after the storm and a favorable change in wind direction aid their final push towards the port. In a race against time to catch the American steamer bound for Yokohama, they signal for assistance as they near Shanghai, hoping to make it in time for Fogg to continue his journey without delay.
