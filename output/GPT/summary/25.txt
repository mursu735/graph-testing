Phileas Fogg, Aouda, Passepartout, and Fix arrive in San Francisco and spend the day exploring the city. They encounter a political rally on Montgomery Street, where Fix protects Fogg from a violent man named Colonel Stamp Proctor. After the incident, they have their clothes repaired and return to the International Hotel. Passepartout, who had been concerned about potential attacks on the train, has purchased several guns for their protection. They leave for the train station in the evening and board a train to their next destination.
