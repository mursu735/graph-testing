Chapter 4:
Packing a modest carpet-bag with essential clothing for both Phileas Fogg and Passepartout: No direct spending here, but implies prior purchases of the items packed.

Filling the carpet-bag with Bank of England notes: No specific spending event, but it's prepared for future expenses.

Taking a cab to Charing Cross: The cost of this cab ride is not specified, but it would be a relatively minor expense, likely a few shillings given the short distance from Saville Row to Charing Cross in that era.

Giving twenty guineas to a beggar: This is a direct expense, where Phileas Fogg hands over the money he had just won at whist.

Purchasing two first-class tickets for Paris: The cost is not specified, but first-class train tickets from London to Paris would have been a significant expense, especially in the context of the 1870s. It's reasonable to estimate this could be several pounds, considering the distance and class of service.

Leaving the gas on in his room: While not an immediate outlay of cash, this represents a financial cost that Phileas Fogg acknowledges will be charged to Passepartout's expense, implying an ongoing cost until their return.

Chapter 5:
None

Chapter 6:
In summary, the provided text does not detail Phileas Fogg's personal expenditures but rather sets the stage for his worldwide journey and the pursuit by detective Fix, along with mentioning operational aspects of the journey like the steamship's coal consumption.

Chapter 7:
Visa Fee Paid by Phileas Fogg: This is the direct expense mentioned, where Fogg pays a customary fee for the visa endorsement on his passport by the consul.

Chapter 8:
Offering a Large Reward to the 'Mongolia's Engineer: Phileas Fogg has promised a considerable sum to the engineer of the 'Mongolia' if the ship reaches Bombay well ahead of the scheduled time. Although the exact amount is not specified, such a reward would likely be substantial to motivate the engineer to exceed the ship's normal operating parameters. This could be speculated to be in the range of several hundred to thousands of pounds, given the context and the significance of the wager Fogg is undertaking.

Passepartout's Planned Purchases: Passepartout intends to buy shoes and shirts, having left London with only a carpet-bag and without trunks. While the text doesn't specify the amount spent, the cost of these items would vary based on the quality and the retailer. Given the urgency and the necessity for durable travel wear, it's reasonable to assume this could amount to a few pounds for each item, totaling possibly in the range of 10-20 pounds for a modest provision of clothing and shoes.

Chapter 9:
Passport Visa Fee: Phileas Fogg and his servant, Passepartout, go ashore at Aden to have the passport visaed again. While the exact amount is not mentioned, there would typically be a nominal fee for visa services. This fee could vary but for estimation purposes, let's assume it's a few pounds or equivalent based on the period and the administrative costs involved.

Coal Refueling at Steamer Point: While not a direct expense of Phileas Fogg, the text mentions the significant cost of fueling steamers, highlighting the operational expenses related to such voyages. The "Mongolia" stops to coal up, which is a substantial yearly expense for the Peninsular Company, mentioned to be around eight hundred thousand pounds. The cost of coal in distant seas is noted to be three or four pounds sterling a ton. This contextual information underscores the economic aspects of steam travel, though it's the shipping company's expenditure.

Whist Game Victory: Towards the end, Fogg concludes a rubber of whist with a victory. While not a direct 'expense,' it signifies the potential gains or losses associated with gambling or betting during the voyage. However, specific monetary details related to the game's stakes are not provided.

Advance Arrival Gains: The "Mongolia" arrives in Bombay two days ahead of schedule, which is marked as a gain in Fogg's itinerary. Though not a monetary expenditure, this early arrival could imply cost savings or the avoidance of additional expenses that might have been incurred with a delayed journey.

Chapter 10:
Dinner at the Railway Station: Phileas Fogg orders dinner at the railway station, which includes a dish that he ultimately finds unpalatable. Estimating the cost of a meal at a station during this period, especially in a British colony, could vary widely based on the dish and the establishment's quality. A reasonable estimate for a dinner in such a context might range from 2 to 5 pounds.

Passport Visa Service: Fogg has his passport visaed again, which implies a government or administrative fee. While the specific cost is not mentioned, such fees typically were nominal, so an estimate could be around 1 pound or less, considering the era and the type of service.

Passepartout's Misadventures and Losses: While not a direct expense incurred by Fogg at this moment, Passepartout's loss of his shoes and package of shirts due to his altercation at the temple could lead to replacement costs that Fogg would likely cover. Estimating the cost of replacing a pair of shoes and several shirts during this period, particularly in a hurry and possibly at tourist prices, we might speculate an expense ranging from 5 to 10 pounds.

Given these considerations, an estimated total of expenses that could be attributed to Phileas Fogg in this segment of the text might reasonably fall within the range of 8 to 16 pounds. This estimation accounts for the direct cost of the meal and the administrative fee for the passport service, along with the inferred future cost of replacing Passepartout's lost items.

Chapter 11:
Purchase of the Elephant: Fogg purchased the elephant for two thousand pounds after his offers of one thousand, twelve hundred, fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred pounds were refused.

Guide Hiring: Fogg hired a young Parsee as a guide for their journey to Allahabad. The specific amount promised as a reward is not mentioned, but given Fogg's generous nature as implied, it could be significant. For estimation, let's consider a reward that might range from 50 to 100 pounds, considering the task's difficulty and the urgency.

Provisions for the Journey: They purchased provisions at Kholby for the journey. Although the exact cost is not specified, considering the need for food and possibly other necessities for three people and an elephant, let's estimate this expense to be around 20 pounds.

Elephant Purchase: 2,000 pounds
Guide Hiring: Let's estimate at 75 pounds (mid-point of the 50 to 100 pounds range)
Provisions: 20 pounds

Total Estimated Expenses: 2,095 pounds

Chapter 12:
No specific amounts of money spent by Phileas Fogg are mentioned.
No list of events involving spending money by Phileas Fogg is available from this segment.

As a result, an estimated sum cannot be provided from this text segment since it does not detail any monetary transactions or expenditures by Phileas Fogg.

Chapter 13:
The explicit amount mentioned is the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds. (spent previously)

For the other activities, no specific monetary values are provided, so they cannot be accurately quantified without further information. Therefore, based on the explicit information given, Phileas Fogg spends two thousand pounds during this segment of his journey, with additional, unspecified costs likely incurred for the rescue operation and subsequent evasion of capture.

Chapter 14:
The explicit cost mentioned is seventy-five pounds for Aouda's attire and essentials.

The gift of the elephant to the guide, while not directly a cash expenditure, represents a considerable financial gesture given its purchase for two thousand pounds.

The cost for the guide's services is not specified but is acknowledged as settled.

Additional travel expenses are implied but not quantified.

Chapter 15:
Bail for Passepartout and Phileas Fogg: After being accused of sacrilege and brought before a judge, Phileas Fogg is fined one hundred and fifty pounds, and Passepartout is fined three hundred pounds. Additionally, Phileas Fogg offers bail for both himself and Passepartout, which is set at one thousand pounds each, totaling two thousand pounds for their temporary release.

Miscellaneous Expenses: While not explicitly mentioned in this segment, Phileas Fogg and his party continue their journey, which implies further travel expenses. These include their departure towards the Hong Kong steamer and any costs associated with their transport from the court to the quay. Although these costs are not specified, they contribute to the overall expenditure.

Estimated Sum Based on Provided Information:

Fines: One hundred and fifty pounds for Fogg + three hundred pounds for Passepartout = 450 pounds.
Bail: One thousand pounds for Fogg + one thousand pounds for Passepartout = 2,000 pounds.
Total Explicit Costs: 2,450 pounds.

Additional Note: The text also mentions the cumulative expenses since leaving London, including travelling expenses, bribes, the purchase of the elephant, bails, and fines, amounting to over five thousand pounds. However, the specific costs in this segment total 2,450 pounds in fines and bail. The mention of the "five thousand pounds" provides context for the increasing financial pressure on Fogg's wager but is not an additional expense within this specific prompt.

Chapter 16:
Despite the lack of explicit financial transactions in this prompt, we can infer or estimate certain costs based on the context and actions described:

    Travel and Accommodations Aboard the “Rangoon”: Fogg's booking for himself, Aouda, and Passepartout on the “Rangoon” from Calcutta to Hong Kong would involve passenger fares for the journey. While the text does not specify these costs, such expenses are inherent to their travel.

    Aouda's Needs: Fogg ensures Aouda’s comfort during the voyage, which might include expenses for her accommodation, food, and possibly new clothing or necessities bought for her before or during the journey.

    Bail Repayment: Not directly mentioned in this segment but related to the narrative’s context, is the repayment of the bail money posted in Calcutta, which would be returned to Fogg upon their departure, potentially re-entering his pool of resources.

Given the lack of explicit monetary details for transactions in this passage, a precise sum of expenses cannot be accurately calculated. However, the narrative underscores Fogg's ongoing financial output to ensure the success of his journey and the welfare of his companions, demonstrating his readiness to incur whatever expenses necessary to maintain his schedule and obligations.

Chapter 17:
In this passage, there are no explicit mentions of Phileas Fogg spending money, unlike previous instances where his financial transactions were detailed, such as bail payments or the purchase of transport and services. The focus here shifts more towards the interactions between characters, the suspicions and strategies of detective Fix, and the journey's progress aboard the “Rangoon” from Singapore towards Hong Kong.

Chapter 18: (TODO: rerun?) (several hundred pounds)
In this portion of the text, there are a few instances where Phileas Fogg incurs expenses, albeit not all are explicitly quantified. Here's a breakdown of the spending events mentioned:

    Hiring a Palanquin in Hong Kong: Upon landing, Fogg hires a palanquin to take Aouda to the Club Hotel. While the exact cost is not mentioned, hiring transportation would involve a fee.

    Hotel Accommodations: Fogg secures a room for Aouda at the Club Hotel. Again, the specific cost is not detailed, but hotel accommodations would require a payment.

    Three Cabins on the "Carnatic": Fogg instructs Passepartout to book three cabins for their onward journey to Europe. This would be a significant expense, considering the long voyage ahead and the need for multiple cabins.

To provide an estimated sum of these expenses, we'd need to consider the average costs of such services during the late 19th century. However, given the lack of specific figures in the text:

    The hiring of a palanquin for a short distance could be relatively minor compared to the other costs, but it's difficult to assign a precise figure without historical context.
    Hotel accommodations in a reputable establishment like the Club Hotel for one night could vary widely based on the level of luxury and the specific services provided.
    The cost of booking three cabins on a steamship for a transcontinental journey would likely be the most substantial expense listed here. Prices would depend on the class of service and the specific route taken.

Given these variables and the absence of explicit amounts in the text, it's challenging to provide an accurate total sum of Phileas Fogg's expenditures in this segment without making broad assumptions about the costs of travel and accommodation in the period in question.


Chapter 19:
In this extensive excerpt from Jules Verne's "Around the World in Eighty Days," the specific instances where Phileas Fogg spends money are not directly mentioned. However, we can infer certain expenses based on the actions and events described:

    Securing Cabins on the "Carnatic": Fogg had Passepartout secure cabins for their continued journey, which would have been a significant expense, especially considering the urgency and the class of travel Fogg is accustomed to.

    Expenses at the Smoking-House: While the direct spending of Phileas Fogg is not mentioned here, there's an implication of costs associated with the visit to the opium den by Passepartout and Fix. Fix, attempting to intoxicate Passepartout to hinder Fogg's plans, likely incurred some expense for the opium and the alcohol consumed. Although these expenses were incurred by Fix and indirectly by Passepartout, they relate to Fogg's journey since they are part of the efforts to delay or assist in the journey's progress.

Given the context, here are broad estimates for the mentioned expenses:

    Cabins on the "Carnatic": The cost for first-class cabins for three passengers from Hong Kong to Yokohama would have been considerable. While specific fares are not provided, it's reasonable to assume a high price given the urgency and the status of travel. For estimation purposes, let's consider a significant sum that reflects first-class travel for three people over a considerable distance.

    Expenses at the Smoking-House: These costs, while not directly Fogg's, are relevant to the journey's narrative. The expense for the alcohol and opium would vary, but given that it's a plot to intoxicate Passepartout, it might include several rounds of drinks and the opium used. This would be a smaller expense compared to travel costs but noteworthy for its impact on the story.

To estimate a total sum for the explicit cost mentioned (securing cabins), one would have to consider the historical context and the lack of specific prices. The cost for first-class travel for three on a significant sea voyage could easily amount to several hundred pounds at the time, reflecting a substantial portion of Fogg's wager and travel budget. The additional expenses at the smoking-house, primarily incurred by Fix in his attempt to delay Passepartout, would add to the narrative's expenses but are less quantifiable without specific details on the cost of such vices during the period.

Therefore, while we can't provide a precise total sum without more detailed historical fare rates and costs for the indulgences at the smoking-house, it's clear that these events contributed significantly to the journey's overall expenses.

Chapter 20:

From this segment of Jules Verne's "Around the World in Eighty Days," Phileas Fogg incurs several expenses as part of his continued journey and efforts to ensure comfort and efficiency in travel for himself and Aouda. Here's a breakdown and estimation of those expenses:

    Purchases for the Voyage: Fogg makes necessary purchases for Aouda's comfort for the long voyage ahead. While the specific items are not listed, considering Fogg's wealth and the need for quality travel provisions, these could include clothing, personal items, and perhaps travel necessities for a lady, which would have been considerable.

    Dining at the Hotel: They dined at a sumptuously served table-d’hôte, which, given the era and the establishment's likely prestige, would not have been cheap. A luxurious dinner for two in such a setting could be quite expensive.

    Chartering the "Tankadere": Fogg negotiates with John Bunsby to charter the pilot-boat "Tankadere" to take them to Yokohama. He offers £100 per day for the voyage, with an additional reward of £200 if they reach Yokohama in time. Given the urgency and the custom deal, this is a significant expense.

    Earnest Money for the "Tankadere": Fogg gives Bunsby £200 in earnest money to secure the charter, showcasing his serious commitment and adding to his expenses.

    Searching for Passepartout: Fogg leaves a sum of money at the police station to aid in the search for Passepartout, demonstrating his willingness to use his resources to take care of his companions. The exact amount is not specified, but given Fogg's character, it would have been generous enough to motivate a thorough search.

    Luggage Transportation: They send for a palanquin for themselves and a wheelbarrow for their luggage to the wharf, which, although minor compared to the other expenses, still adds to the total cost of this leg of the journey.

Estimated Sum of Expenses:

    Purchases for the Voyage: Given the lack of specifics, an estimation could range widely. For the sake of calculation, let's assume a moderate figure that reflects high-quality goods necessary for a lady's comfort on a long journey.
    Dining at the Hotel: High-end dining for two in such a context could be substantial.
    Chartering the "Tankadere": The charter alone, not counting the earnest money, amounts to £100 per day plus a £200 reward. The duration of the voyage to Yokohama could be several days, leading to a large total.
    Earnest Money: £200 given directly.
    Searching for Passepartout & Luggage Transportation: These costs are more difficult to estimate without specific figures but are relatively minor compared to the charter expense.

Without explicit figures for some of the expenses and considering the variability in costs for provisions and services, a precise total is challenging to calculate. However, the chartering of the "Tankadere" clearly constitutes the bulk of the expenses during this phase, easily reaching into the thousands of pounds when combined with the daily rate, additional reward, earnest money, and the assumed costs for provisions and services.

Chapter 21:
In this segment from "Around the World in Eighty Days," Phileas Fogg undertakes several expenditures as part of his journey:

    Chartering the "Tankadere": Fogg charters the pilot-boat "Tankadere" for a voyage to reach Yokohama, offering £100 per day with an additional reward of £200 if they reach their destination in time. The earnest money provided to secure this arrangement was £200.

    Purchases for the Voyage and Dining: Before embarking on the "Tankadere," Fogg makes necessary purchases for the voyage for Aouda's comfort and dines at a hotel, though the costs are not specified. Given Fogg's propensity for ensuring comfort and the context of the narrative, these could be considerable but unspecified amounts.

    Searching for Passepartout: Fogg leaves a sum of money at the police station in Hong Kong to aid in the search for Passepartout. The exact amount is not mentioned.

    Offer to Fix: Although not an expense incurred, Fogg offers Fix to take advantage of the £200 earnest money as a gesture of goodwill, which adds to the narrative of Fogg's character but does not directly contribute to his expenditures.

Given the details provided:

    Chartering the "Tankadere" itself costs £100 per day plus a £200 bonus for timely arrival, and £200 given as earnest money upfront.
    Purchases and Dining: These are unspecified but could range from modest to significant amounts considering the standards Fogg maintains.
    Searching for Passepartout: An unspecified amount, likely generous given Fogg's means and the urgency of the situation.

Estimated Sum:

    The chartering of the "Tankadere" is explicitly priced at £100 per day with additional conditions for a bonus and earnest money totaling at least £400 directly specified.
    The other expenditures, while important for the narrative, are not quantified in monetary terms within the text provided.

Without explicit amounts for dining, purchases, and the search for Passepartout, the total estimated sum can primarily account for the charter and earnest money totaling a minimum of £400 plus the potential reward if successful. The unspecified expenses would add to this base amount, but without clear figures, they remain indeterminate within the scope of this analysis.

Chapter 22:
In this segment, Phileas Fogg incurs several types of expenses, some of which are explicitly mentioned and others implied by the context of his actions:

    Unoccupied State-Rooms on the "Carnatic": Fogg had engaged two state-rooms on the "Carnatic" which went unused because he and Aouda did not board the steamer. The cost of these state-rooms is not specified, but given the era and the nature of travel, this would likely be a significant expense. For estimation purposes, considering the long journey from Hong Kong to Japan and the class of accommodation (given Fogg's preferences for comfort), the cost of these state-rooms could be substantial.

    Purchases for the Voyage: Before boarding the "Tankadere," Fogg makes necessary purchases for the long voyage ahead, especially considering Aouda's comfort. While the text does not specify the amount spent, it is implied to be a well-considered and likely generous amount, given Fogg's attention to detail and willingness to ensure comfort.

    Dining at the Hotel: Fogg and Aouda dine at a hotel before attempting to board the "Carnatic," which would add to his expenses. The cost is not specified, but given Fogg's tendency for fine living, this would not have been an inexpensive meal.

    Chartering the "Tankadere": This expense occurs in a previous segment, where Fogg charters a pilot boat to reach Yokohama in time, agreeing to £100 per day plus an additional reward of £200 if successful, and giving £200 earnest money upfront. This significant expense reflects Fogg's determination to maintain his schedule at any cost.

Estimated Sum:

    The exact cost of the two state-rooms on the "Carnatic" is not provided, but based on the context and considering Fogg's standards, it could be estimated in the range of several hundred pounds.
    Purchases for the voyage and dining at the hotel would also contribute to the expenses, likely totaling in the tens to low hundreds of pounds, given the era and Fogg's propensity for quality and comfort.
    The charter of the "Tankadere" is a known expense of at least £400 plus the potential for an additional £200 reward, totaling £600 if successful.

Given these considerations, without exact figures for the hotel dining and purchases for the voyage, and assuming the state-room costs could align with or exceed the charter costs due to the luxury and urgency, a rough estimation could place Fogg's total expenditures in this segment in the ballpark of several hundred to over a thousand pounds, encompassing the known and estimated costs. This does not account for daily expenses and incidentals, which would add to the total.


Chapter 23:
In this segment, Phileas Fogg incurs the following expenses:

    Compensation to Mr. Batulcar: Fogg pays Mr. Batulcar a handful of banknotes as compensation for the disruption caused at the theatre. While the exact amount is not specified, given that it was to appease Mr. Batulcar's fury over the "breakage" of the pyramid, it can be inferred to be a significant sum. Given the context and the likely high cost of the damages, this could reasonably be estimated in the range of several hundred pounds, especially considering Fogg's propensity to resolve issues swiftly and without much haggling over the price.

Considering the lack of specific monetary amounts in this segment, providing an accurate total is challenging. However, based on the inferred significant sum handed to Mr. Batulcar, the estimated expense could be several hundred pounds. This estimation accounts for the likely high cost of compensating for the theatre damages and appeasing Mr. Batulcar's demand for damages, reflecting Fogg's approach of using his wealth to navigate and resolve obstacles quickly during his journey.

Chapter 24: (previous costs)
In the provided text, Phileas Fogg incurs the following expenses:

    Payment to John Bunsby: Fogg compensates John Bunsby, the pilot of the "Tankadere", the agreed price for his passage. Additionally, Fogg rewards Bunsby with an extra sum of five hundred and fifty pounds for his services. This payment is explicitly mentioned.

    Compensation for the Theatre Disruption: After the incident at the Honourable Mr. Batulcar’s theatre, where Passepartout's unexpected participation in a performance causes a disruption, Phileas Fogg appeases Mr. Batulcar by giving him a handful of banknotes as compensation for the "breakage" of the pyramid. While the exact amount is not specified, it is described as a handful of banknotes, indicating a significant sum, likely in response to the damages and to avoid any further inconvenience.

Given these details, the total explicit expenditure mentioned is five hundred and fifty pounds paid to John Bunsby. The unspecified amount given to Mr. Batulcar can only be estimated. Considering Fogg's tendency to resolve financial matters generously and without dispute, it's reasonable to infer this could be a substantial amount, possibly in the hundreds of pounds, but without explicit details, providing a precise figure for this payment is speculative.

Estimated Sum: 550 pounds (explicit) + an unspecified amount to Mr. Batulcar (likely substantial but indeterminate). The exact total cannot be precisely calculated due to the unspecified nature of the second expense.

Chapter 25:
From the provided text, Phileas Fogg's expenditures are as follows:

    Carriage Hire to the International Hotel: Upon arrival in San Francisco, Mr. Fogg hires a carriage for $3 to transport himself, Aouda, and Passepartout to the International Hotel.

    New Outfits for Mr. Fogg and Fix: After an altercation that leaves their clothing in tatters, Mr. Fogg and Fix purchase new outfits. The cost is not specified.

    Compensation to Mr. Batulcar: In a separate incident (referenced in a previous analysis), Mr. Fogg compensates Mr. Batulcar for damages at his theatre and for the inconvenience caused. The amount given to Mr. Batulcar directly for this incident in the text is not mentioned here, but it was previously noted as a "handful of banknotes" in addition to the payment for passage and a reward to the pilot, totalling 550 pounds.

For the events explicitly mentioned in this particular text:

    Total Explicit Cost: $3 for the carriage hire.
    New Outfits for Mr. Fogg and Fix: The cost is unspecified but required due to the damage incurred during the political rally altercation.

Estimated Sum for Specified Events:

    Given the explicit cost of $3 for carriage hire, and acknowledging the unspecified cost for new outfits, the total can only be partially calculated. The purchase of new outfits would likely add significantly to the expenses, but without a specific amount, an accurate total cannot be determined from the information provided in this text alone.

Chapter 26:
The provided text does not explicitly detail any expenditures by Phileas Fogg. It describes the journey of Mr. Fogg and his companions across the United States by train, including the scenery, encounters with wildlife, and the infrastructure of the Pacific Railroad, but does not mention specific instances of Mr. Fogg spending money. Therefore, there are no financial transactions to summarize from this section of the text

Chapter 27:
The provided text does not explicitly detail any expenditures by Phileas Fogg. It focuses on the journey across the United States, a lecture on Mormonism, and the unique social structures of Salt Lake City, but does not mention specific instances of Mr. Fogg spending money. Therefore, there are no financial transactions to summarize from this section of the text.

Chapter 28:
In the provided text, there are no explicit mentions of Phileas Fogg spending money. The focus is primarily on the journey of the train, the challenge of crossing a dangerous bridge, and the actions and interactions of the characters aboard the train. Therefore, there are no financial transactions to summarize from this section of the text.

Chapter 29:
In the provided text, there are no explicit mentions of Phileas Fogg spending money. The focus is primarily on the journey of the train through various territories and the dramatic attack by the Sioux, which results in a dangerous and action-packed situation for Fogg and his companions. Therefore, there are no financial transactions to summarize from this section of the text.

Chapter 30:
Phileas Fogg promised to divide a sum of $5,000 among the soldiers for their assistance in the rescue operation. Converted into British pounds at the approximate 1870s exchange rate, this amount would be around £1,000.

Therefore, based on the provided text, Phileas Fogg's expenditure or financial commitment related to rescuing the prisoners can be estimated at £1,000. 

Chapter 31:
In the provided text, there are indirect references to financial transactions made by Phileas Fogg but no explicit amounts mentioned for these specific expenses. Here are the events related to potential financial transactions:

    Bargain Made for the Land-Craft (Sledge): Mr. Fogg examines and subsequently makes a deal for the use of a unique sledge equipped with sails to transport him and his party to Omaha. While the exact amount is not specified, it's clear that a financial agreement was reached to compensate the owner of the sledge for this urgent and unconventional journey.

    Reward to Mudge: After successfully arriving near Omaha thanks to the sledge piloted by Mudge, Phileas Fogg generously rewards Mudge for his service. Although the text does not disclose the reward amount, it indicates a financial transaction as a form of gratitude for Mudge's significant role in helping them progress on their journey.

Given the absence of specific amounts, it's not possible to provide an estimated sum for these transactions directly from the text. However, considering the urgency of the situation and the unique services rendered, we can infer that Phileas Fogg likely compensated these services generously, maintaining his pattern of resolving obstacles through financial means.

Chapter 32:
In the provided text, the financial transactions related to Phileas Fogg's efforts to secure passage to Liverpool are detailed with specific amounts for a significant transaction:

    Phileas Fogg's expenditure for chartering the vessel "Henrietta" to transport him and three others to Liverpool amounted to $8,000. Converted into British pounds at the approximate 1870s exchange rate, this amount would be around £1,600.

Chapter 33:
In the provided text, Phileas Fogg engages in significant financial transactions to ensure his continued journey towards fulfilling his wager. Here are the key events involving spending or commitments to spending money, along with estimates where explicit amounts are not provided:

    Purchasing the "Henrietta": Phileas Fogg buys the "Henrietta" from Captain Speedy for $50,000. This is a direct transaction where Fogg takes ownership of the vessel to ensure he can reach Liverpool.

    Converting the "Henrietta" for Fuel: To maintain steam and ensure the vessel can reach its destination, the interior and parts of the "Henrietta" are dismantled and burned for fuel. While a specific cost is not associated with this action in monetary terms, the act of dismantling a recently purchased vessel for fuel represents a significant financial loss beyond the purchase price, considering the destruction of value. However, for calculation purposes, we will focus on explicit transactions.

    Bribery and Crew Wages: While not explicitly quantified in this segment, it's implied that Fogg managed to sway the crew to his side, likely involving financial incentives. Since no specific amount is given, we cannot add this to the total but acknowledge it as an implied expense.

    The Final Leg from Queenstown to Liverpool: The cost of this journey, including the express train from Queenstown to Dublin and the steamer to Liverpool, is not specified. However, given the urgency and the need to charter or secure rapid passage, it's reasonable to infer significant expenditure. For calculation, we will focus only on explicit amounts provided.

Phileas Fogg's expenditure for purchasing the vessel "Henrietta" amounted to $60,000. Converted into British pounds at the approximate 1870s exchange rate, this amount would be around £12,000.

Therefore, the primary financial transaction detailed in the provided text, which can be quantified, is the purchase of the "Henrietta" for a total estimated cost of £12,000. This does not account for the unspecified sum used to bribe the crew into supporting his commandeering of the ship, which would add to the total expenditure in an unquantified manner.

Chapter 34:
In the given text, Phileas Fogg undertakes several financial actions to facilitate his return to London, though not all of them are quantified in terms of monetary value. Here's a breakdown of the events involving expenditures or potential expenditures:

    Chartering a Special Train: Phileas Fogg orders a special train to take him from Liverpool to London after missing the express train. Although the exact amount spent on chartering this special train is not specified in the text, it is implied to be a significant expense due to the urgency and the nature of the request. Chartering a special train during this period would indeed involve a considerable sum, but without a specific figure provided in the text, we can only acknowledge it as a substantial expenditure.

Given the information in the text, there are no explicit monetary amounts mentioned for the actions taken by Phileas Fogg. Therefore, we cannot provide an estimated sum of money spent based solely on the provided prompt. The significant action of chartering a special train suggests a notable expense, indicative of Fogg's willingness to invest considerable resources to complete his journey, but without a specified amount, we cannot calculate a total expenditure.
