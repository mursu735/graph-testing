Since\u003cbr\u003ehe had abandoned his own country for England, taking service\u003cbr\u003eas a valet, he had in vain searched for a master after his\u003cbr\u003eown heart. Passepartout was by no means one of those pert\u003cbr\u003edunces depicted by Moli\u00e8re with a bold gaze and a nose held\u003cbr\u003ehigh in the air; he was an honest fellow, with a pleasant\u003cbr\u003eface, lips a trifle protruding, soft-mannered and\u003cbr\u003eserviceable, with a good round head, such as one likes to\u003cbr\u003esee on the shoulders of a friend. His eyes were blue, his\u003cbr\u003ecomplexion rubicund, his figure almost portly and well-\u003cbr\u003ebuilt, his body muscular, and his physical powers fully\u003cbr\u003edeveloped by the exercises of his younger days. His brown\u003cbr\u003ehair was somewhat tumbled; for, while the ancient sculptors\u003cbr\u003eare said to have known eighteen methods of arranging\u003cbr\u003eMinerva\u2019s tresses, Passepartout was familiar with but one of\u003cbr\u003edressing his own: three strokes of a large-tooth comb\u003cbr\u003ecompleted his toilet.\u002fIt would be rash to predict how\u003cbr\u003ePassepartout\u2019s lively nature would agree with Mr. Fogg. It\u003cbr\u003ewas impossible to tell whether the new servant would turn\u003cbr\u003eout as absolutely methodical as his master required;\u003cbr\u003eexperience alone could solve the question. Passepartout had\u003cbr\u003ebeen a sort of vagrant in his early years, and now yearned\u003cbr\u003efor repose; but so far he had failed to find it, though he\u003cbr\u003ehad already served in ten English houses. But he could not\u003cbr\u003etake root in any of these; with chagrin, he found his\u003cbr\u003emasters invariably whimsical and irregular, constantly\u003cbr\u003erunning about the country, or on the look-out for adventure.\u003cbr\u003eHis last master, young Lord Longferry, Member of Parliament,\u003cbr\u003eafter passing his nights in the Haymarket taverns, was too\u003cbr\u003eoften brought home in the morning on policemen\u2019s shoulders.\u003cbr\u003ePassepartout, desirous of respecting the gentleman whom he\u003cbr\u003eserved, ventured a mild remonstrance on such conduct; which,\u003cbr\u003ebeing ill-received, he took his leave. Hearing that Mr.\u003cbr\u003ePhileas Fogg was looking for a servant, and that his life\u003cbr\u003ewas one of unbroken regularity, that he neither travelled\u003cbr\u003enor stayed from home overnight, he felt sure that this would\u003cbr\u003ebe the place he was after.
