## Prerequisites for running spaCy with en_core_web_trf model

1. Install torch with CUDA enabled, instructions are available on PyTorch website
 (if torch is already installed, it should be uninstalled first)
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` this should download all models

If this does not work, replace model with `en_core_web_sm`
